 # ulauncher-tldr

This is a ulauncher extension for [tldr.sh pages](https://tldr.sh/). It offers a search for tldr pages, shows the pages
in a list-style and can copy the displayed commands to the clipboard.

Note that this downloads the complete tldr pages via `git` to a local directory (`~/.cache/tldr-python`) and regularly updates this git repository.

## Requirements 

* git
* python >= 3.8 (it won't work for older versions)

## Installation

Installation instructions can be found at https://ext.ulauncher.io/about.
